## Information
Since the teacher is an idiot, he demands that everything be done via VMs in the school's EIT computer lab.
So after communicating with the teacher, who absolutely did not want to cooperate, he told me in a maximum annoyance that it could be done from his own PC.

You can just get around that by putting 


```bash
chown {login}:{login} {file_name}
```

**And he won't know anything and he'll be happy, and so complications can be avoided**
